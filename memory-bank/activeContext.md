# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in its implementation phase. The basic module structure has been established, and we have implemented the core functionality for Bitcoin and alkanes metaprotocol interactions. The primary goal is to create a comprehensive toolkit that can interact with Bitcoin and the alkanes metaprotocol using BDK with a custom JSON-RPC provider, replacing the need for esplora while adding metashrew_view RPC calls for rendering alkanes view functions.

We have created a comprehensive reference document (`oyl-sdk-alkanes-reference.md`) that details how deezel maps to the alkanes functionality in oyl-sdk and serves as a guide for our implementation.

     - `deezel alkanes getbytecode <block:tx>`
     - `deezel alkanes protorunesbyaddress <address>`
     - `deezel alkanes protorunesbyoutpoint <txid:vout>`
     - `deezel alkanes spendablesbyaddress <address>`
     - `deezel alkanes traceblock <blockheight>`
     - `deezel alkanes trace <txid:vout>`
     - `deezel alkanes simulate <block:tx:input1:input2...>`

## Alkanes Metaprotocol Compatibility

As part of our development efforts, we are focusing on ensuring that deezel can serve as a comprehensive toolkit for interacting with Bitcoin and the alkanes metaprotocol. This involves:

1. **API Compatibility**
   - Implementing equivalent RPC methods to those used by alkanes
   - Ensuring consistent behavior for key operations like token minting and tracing

2. **Functionality Mapping**
   - Mapping alkanes functions to deezel components
   - Implementing core operations supported by the alkanes metaprotocol

3. **Command-Line Interface**
   - Providing a CLI that supports the key alkanes commands
   - Ensuring consistent parameter handling and output formatting

4. **Runestone/Protostone Support**
   - Implementing comprehensive Runestone decoding for all protostones
   - Supporting various cellpack structures and interpretations
   - Enabling interaction with the alkanes metaprotocol

The `oyl-sdk-alkanes-reference.md` document in the memory-bank provides a detailed mapping between alkanes functionality and deezel components, serving as a guide for our implementation.
